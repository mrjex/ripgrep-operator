# Ripgrep Operator

Ripgrep (`rg`) is a fast command-line search tool, like `grep`, but more efficient for recursive searches. It's commonly installed as a standalone binary or via package managers like `apt`, `brew`, or `snap`.

In essence, this project uses the [Ripgrep Snap Package](https://snapcraft.io/ripgrep) as a baseline and extends it into a standalone deployed and orchestrated Charm component on Juju, tailored for a wider range of use cases.
